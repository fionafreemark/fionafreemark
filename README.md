## Hey, I'm Fiona! 👩🏻‍💻
I'm a front-end developer and artist with 10 years of experience in the **design, production and presentation of artworks** online and in-person. I bring a unique blend of **creative and technical skills** to the table.

As a recent graduate of Juno College's Immersive Web Development Bootcamp, I am well-versed in the latest web development technologies, including **React, ES6, Firebase, SASS, CSS3, and HTML5.** I am passionate about using these tools to build **accessible and responsive code** that meets the needs of modern web users.

With a **keen eye for design and an unwavering attention to detail**, I strive to build pixel-perfect websites that are not only functional but also visually stunning. I am always using my **problem-solving abilities to look for innovative ways to bring my artistic vision to life** as I take on new projects and continue to grow my tech stack.
