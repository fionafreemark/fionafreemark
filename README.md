## Hey, I'm Fiona! 👩🏻‍💻
#### I am a front-end developer and creative with 10 years of experience in design, production and presentation of artworks in digital and physical platforms. As a recent graduate of Juno College's Immersive Web Development Bootcamp, I am passionate about building accessible, responsive code using React, ES6, Firebase, SASS, CSS3 & HTML5. I bring my love of art into every project, leveraging my eye for design, attention to detail, and problem solving abilities to build pixel perfect websites.
